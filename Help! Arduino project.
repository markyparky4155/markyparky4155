- 👋 Hi, I’m @markyparky4155
- 👀 I’m interested in writing a sketch for Arduino 2560 R3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Very slowly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on producing a sketch to emulate old UK "call progress tones"
- These are. Dial tone (DT), Ring Tone (RT), Busy Tone (BT) & Number Unobtainable Tone (NUT)
- Also the sketch should allow for a number of pcb relays to produce (RT) as a cadence, to enable the relay to supply ringing current
- I have a pcb board that supplies the correct voltage and frequency. The sketch should send a pulse to relay of 1sec duration every
- 30 seconds. This would allow the user to have clocks that require this pulse. I'm not sure if this allowed, but I would be willing
- to share the profit for the high quality units. We could look at markets outside the UK and vary the sketch for individual
- country tones.
- 📫 How to reach me at alcroc@gmail.com
- Looking forward to hearing from you. Mark.
